    "# Totango SuccessPlay Data Extraction\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "This script is designed to automate the extraction of SuccessPlay statistics from Totango, utilizing the app.totango.com/api/v3/tasks/export/csv?query API. The key feature is the conversion of manual data extraction process from the UI into an automated script-based approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Utilizes Totango's tasks/export API to fetch SuccessPlay data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The script makes use of a GET request with query parameters that can be obtained from the browser URL when downloading SuccessPlay data manually.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Automates the extraction of SuccessPlay data, saving time and providing an easily repeatable process.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Allows easy integration of the data extraction process into larger workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Enables possibilities for in-depth analysis, reporting, and optimization of customer success strategies."
