    "# Totango API CSV Data Integration \n",
    "\n",
    "This script automates the process of uploading data to Totango by triggering an API endpoint. This approach allows you to start uploading your data to Totango immediately after your in-house data preparation process finishes, increasing efficiency and reducing manual work.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python script performs the following operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Reads data from a CSV file:** The script reads a CSV file from a provided file path. Each row of the CSV file represents an account, with various attributes of the account represented as columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Processes the CSV data:** The script processes the CSV data line by line, constructing a JSON object for each account. It bundles these JSON objects into groups defined by a `PROCESSED_LIMIT`, which is a predefined constant that determines how many accounts should be processed at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Sends data to the Totango API:** For each group of accounts, the script sends a POST request to a specific Totango API endpoint. The POST request includes the account data in JSON format and an authorization token for authentication purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The above operations are designed to be triggered when the in-house data preparation process is complete. It ensures the data is uploaded to Totango as soon as it is ready, enhancing the speed and timeliness of data integration.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more details on how to trigger an integration using an API endpoint in Totango, you can visit the [official Totango documentation](https://support.totango.com/hc/en-us/articles/360029053931-Trigger-an-integration-using-an-API-endpoint)."
